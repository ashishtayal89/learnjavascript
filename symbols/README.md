# Notes

- Primitive datatype with least operator
- Used to define inner private properties/identifier of an object ie properties used inside a class
- Anonymous and non-enumerable property
- Whenever an object needs to be iterated (such as at the beginning of a for..of loop), its @@iterator method is called with no arguments, and the returned iterator is used to obtain the values to be iterated.
- Well known symbols
